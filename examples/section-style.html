    <header><b>J. R. "Bob" Dobbs</b> is the figurehead of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_SubGenius">Church of the SubGenius</a>.</header>
    <main>
        His image is derived from a piece of <i>1950s clip art</i>. According to SubGenius dogma, "Bob" was a drilling equipment salesman who, in 1953, saw a vision of <strike>God</strike> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah_1">JHVH-1</a> according to Church scriptures) on a television set he had built himself. The vision inspired him to write the "PreScriptures" (as described in the Book of the SubGenius) and found the Church.
